# Title: Struggling to run this in Gitbash
This project is to be run from the git bash command line and is meant to cause Maya standalone to produce spheres which can change in color. Unfortunately it does not function appropriately for me.

## Installation
1. Download the file from github 
2.open git bash and declare an environment variable 
3. aim git bash at the file you've downloaded from git hub with the file path Z:\MasterBuilder\Drexel Work\Fall2025\New Folder With Items\TechDirecting for Anim\anim-435-2025-zc399\assignment4\bin\assignment4.py 
4. execute within git bash   

Prognosis:    Â 
When running the code I still recieved an initial error indicating to change code on line 12 even after I did change code for line 12. Hopefully you didn't encounter this same mistake. 

I am still unsure as to what to do in order to solve this problem but it doesn't seem to have an affect over producing the sphere and its colors. 

## Usage

Within Gitbash use this code to open a environmental variable executable in mayapy
